## Executive Summary
Team 13 will be designing an original multiplayer game, with the goal of connecting people during times of social distancing. The game will be playable in a browser and users will be able to choose who they connect to. The system for allowing users to find each other will be a short randomized code, which can be shared using outside means like text or video communications. Players can maintain privacy by only sharing their code with people they choose. Only the usernames of players will be shared with other players, and all other information will be kept private. 

The main function of the game will be players competing against each other in a two dimensional obstacle course. Using user friendly interface, simple movement, and easy to understand controls, players will move from start to finish and compete to see who can finish first. The games will be short, a few minutes long, so people will not need to allocate a large amount of time to play. During times of social distancing, our game aims to provide a means of connecting with other people for a short moment of fun, before continuing with the rest of their day. 

## Competitive Analysis
Key Features: Competitor vs Team 13
|Competitor (Fall Guys)|	Team 13|
|---|---|
|Online Multiplayer	|Code Based Lobby|
|3D-Graphics|	2D-Graphics|
|Third Person|	Side-View|
|Winner Take all|	Point System|
|Customizable Avatars|	Customizable Avatars|

One of the major competitors that came to mind when coming up with our idea was the fame Fall Guys. When people think of online obstacle game, they think of Fall Guys. The first key difference will be how the multiplayer works. Fall Guys requires around a 50-person lobby which means there is no way to play solely with your friends. Our idea is to use a code invite system and have the games on a smaller scale so that games can take place between friends. Fall Guys takes place in a 3D environment, while our game will be in 2D. In this day and age, a games success has little to do with the dimensions of the game and more to do with how it makes use of the space. Only being in 2D will allow us to spend more time making the physics work well and give the user more control over their avatar. Our game will be using a side-view perspective which will allow the user to have precise control over the two dimensions they can move in. Fall Guysâ€™ movement is much less focused on precision and more on situational awareness which allows are game to fill a difference niche. The point system between the two games will also be different. Fall Guys utilizes a winner take all when it comes to receiving rewards from playing. Our game will have a point system that will allow even those who come in second or third to earn rewards and have a sense of progression. Finally, you need a way to spend these points and this is where the two games will behave the same. The points players earn through their accomplishments will be used to buy customizable items to personalizer their avatars.

**Bugs or Glitches**: Issues or problems that happen when the game do things that it was not supposed to do.

**Player**: User playing the game.

**Host**: User that starts a game and can share a code with other users so that these users can join the host's game.

**Main lobby**: A screen where a logged-in user can start or join a game.

**User Account**: Account information for a user.


## Overview, Scenarios and Use Cases

### Scenario One
     
   * David is a freshman at Florida Atlantic University. He would like to partake in a game that will help him meet new friends since all of his classes are online due to the pandemic. He meets someone named Paul through a Discussion post on Canvas. David invites Paul to play a game. He shares a procedurally-generated code with Paul, which allows him to join a session.
   
### Scenario Two
     
   * Sofia primarily uses a mobile device to access media. She is a fairly novice gamer and wants to use gaming to feel more connected with her online classmates. She installs the game and invites a few classmates to play.
   
### Scenario Three
     
   * Max has a new computer. He would like to utilize the computer to play a game, not necessarily as a benchmark, in order to "break it in" with some friends that he has not seen in a while due to the pandemic. He sends some of his friends an invite code and they join a session together.


### Use Case 1: User Login
1. The user opens the game.
2. The user enters their username.
3. The user enters their password.
4. The user clicks on the "Login" button.


### Use Case 2: User Signs Up for an Account
1. The user opens the game.
2. The user clicks on the "Sign Up" link.
3. The user enters their email.
4. The user enters a unique username.
5. The user enters a password.
6. The user confirms their password.
7. The user clicks on "Sign Up."

### Use Case 3: User Hosts a Game
1. The user logs in successfully.
2. The user clicks on the "Host Game" button.
3. The user enters the room name and shares the given code with their friends.
4. The user clicks on the "Create Room" button.

### Use Case 4: User Joins a Game
1. The user logs in successfully.
2. The user clicks on the "Join Game" button.
3. The user enters the code that was shared with them by the host.
4. The user clicks on the "Join Game" button.

### Use Case 5: User Plays a Game
1. The user successfully hosts or joins a game.
2. The user chooses the color of their character.
3. The user waits for other players to join the game.
4. The user votes for the level that they prefer.
5. The user begins playing the game when the host clicks on the "Play" button.
6. The user sees the ranking of each player's score at the end of the game.
7. The user can play the game again if the host clicks on the "Restart" button.

## High-Level System Architecture

### Database

Use MySQL database service on the Lamp server. The database will store the playersâ€™ login information (unique username and hashed password), game data, and their highest score.

### Server
Use our groupâ€™s LAMP server provided by the university.

### Client-Server Relationship

* Client-side: JavaScript
* Server-side: C#

### APIâ€™s

* Last.fm API: Allows the exploring of the entire collection of the websiteâ€™s music data resources, such as artists and playlists.
https://english.api.rakuten.net/dimashirokov/api/LastFm

### Supported Browsers
* Google Chrome
* Firefox

### GUI

## Key Risks
   The individuals in our team have provided a diverse skill set that has allowed as to avoid most skill or knowledge-based risks. One risk that has been plaguing our group from the beginning is scheduling. Our goal was to have daily, brief, scrum meetings to coordinate and keep track of progress.  Having all members of the group daily has been a struggle but we have been bolstering our communication through instant messaging and keeping detailed minutes of meetings to share with members who miss meetings. A risk that might affect us in the future has to do with the LAMP server. We plan to host our video game on the lamp server to allow multiplayer function. The strength of the lamp server is unknown to us and may cause issues and may limit the number of players who can play at once or limit the complexity of our game. The sooner we can begin beta testing on the server, the sooner we will understand our limitations, if there are any.
