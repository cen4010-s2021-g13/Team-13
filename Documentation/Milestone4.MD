# Product Summary

# Usability Test Plan

## Test Objectives

The usability test objectives is to assess how easily the game can be played and used by the end users. This measure can be evaluated based on the time and level of skill required to learn how to play the game. Also, the objectives of the test is to examine the user's attitudes towards playing the game, ensuring that the users can complete the main actions that they need to, and have an efficient experience. Thus, the test will help reveal areas of confusion and identify any usability issues that are present in the game so that they can be resolved before the final delivery of the game.

Specifically, the objective of the "System Setup" tests is to make sure that the game can be accessed using the requirements listed in the test cases, such as hardware, OS, browsers, and Wi-Fi. The objective of the "Starting Point" tests is to ensure that the players experience the correct starting point for playing the game. The starting point should include the correct amount of lives and points, and the correct location of the character on the map. The objective of the "Task to be Accomplished" tests is to make sure that the player can fulfill the main tasks of the game, such as movement and earning points. The objective of the "Who is the Intended User" test is to examine whether the proposed intended user is a correct fit for the game. The objective of the "Completion Criteria" test is to assess whether the game successfully ends when there are no more lives remaining. The objective of "The URL of the System to be Tested" test is to evaluate whether the game can be accessed with the URL provided.
