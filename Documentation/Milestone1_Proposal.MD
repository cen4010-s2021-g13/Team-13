## Executive Summary
Team 13 will be making a project aimed at connecting during social distancing through the use of a multiplayer game. The game will be playable in a browser and users will be able to choose who they connect to. The system for allowing users to find each other will be a short randomized code, which can be shared using outside means like text or video communications. Players can maintain privacy by only sharing their code with people they choose. Only the usernames of players will be shared with other players, and all other information will be kept private. 

The main function of the game will be players competing against each other in a two dimensional obstacle course. Using user friendly interface, simple movement, and easy to understand controls, players will move from start to finish and compete to see who can finish first. The games will be short, a few minutes long, so people will not need to allocate a large amount of time to play. During times of social distancing, our game aims to provide a means of connecting with other people for a short moment of fun, before continuing with the rest of their day. 

## Competitive Analysis

## Overview, scenarios and use cases

## High-level Functional Requirements

## Non-functional Requirements

## High-Level System Architecture

### Database

Use MySQL database service on the Lamp server. The database will store the players’ login information (unique username and hashed password), game data, and their highest score.

### Server
Use our group’s LAMP server provided by the university.

### Client-Server Relationship

* Client-side: JavaScript
* Server-side: PHP

### API’s
* Vulkan API: Graphics API developed by Khronos
https://www.khronos.org/vulkan/

* Last.fm API: Allows the exploring of the entire collection of the website’s music data resources, such as artists and playlists.
