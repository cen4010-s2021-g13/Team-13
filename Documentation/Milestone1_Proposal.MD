## Executive Summary
Team 13 will be designing an original multiplayer game, with the goal of connecting people during times of social distancing. The game will be playable in a browser and users will be able to choose who they connect to. The system for allowing users to find each other will be a short randomized code, which can be shared using outside means like text or video communications. Players can maintain privacy by only sharing their code with people they choose. Only the usernames of players will be shared with other players, and all other information will be kept private. 

The main function of the game will be players competing against each other in a two dimensional obstacle course. Using user friendly interface, simple movement, and easy to understand controls, players will move from start to finish and compete to see who can finish first. The games will be short, a few minutes long, so people will not need to allocate a large amount of time to play. During times of social distancing, our game aims to provide a means of connecting with other people for a short moment of fun, before continuing with the rest of their day. 

## Competitive Analysis
Key Features: Competitor vs Team 13
|Competitor (Fall Guys)|	Team 13|
|---|---|
|Online Multiplayer	|Code Based Lobby|
|3D-Graphics|	2D-Graphics|
|Third Person|	Side-View|
|Winner Take all|	Point System|
|Customizable Avatars|	Customizable Avatars|

One of the major competitors that came to mind when coming up with our idea was the fame Fall Guys. When people think of online obstacle game, they think of Fall Guys. The first key difference will be how the multiplayer works. Fall Guys requires around a 50-person lobby which means there is no way to play solely with your friends. Our idea is to use a code invite system and have the games on a smaller scale so that games can take place between friends. Fall Guys takes place in a 3D environment, while our game will be in 2D. In this day and age, a games success has little to do with the dimensions of the game and more to do with how it makes use of the space. Only being in 2D will allow us to spend more time making the physics work well and give the user more control over their avatar. Our game will be using a side-view perspective which will allow the user to have precise control over the two dimensions they can move in. Fall Guysâ€™ movement is much less focused on precision and more on situational awareness which allows are game to fill a difference niche. The point system between the two games will also be different. Fall Guys utilizes a winner take all when it comes to receiving rewards from playing. Our game will have a point system that will allow even those who come in second or third to earn rewards and have a sense of progression. Finally, you need a way to spend these points and this is where the two games will behave the same. The points players earn through their accomplishments will be used to buy customizable items to personalizer their avatars.

## Data Definition

**LAMP Server**: Linux Apache MySQL PHP [LAMP] server, provided by FAU, provides access to Linux (via SSH access) ), Apache (for web based development via PHP or CGI-BIN), MySQL (for database development), PHP (for web based development, and Tomcat (for java based web development).

**Unity**: American video game software development company used for the development of the game.

**OS**: The operational system

**Frame Rate**: The frequency of images (called frames) being displayed on the screen. Measured in frames per second (fps)

**Netcode**: The syncronization between the client and server side of the game.

**Bugs or Glitches**: Issues or problems that happen when the game do things that it was not supposed to do.

**Player**: User playing the game.

**Host**: User that starts a game and can share a code with other users so that these users can join the host's game.

**Code**: A string composed of 5 random letters and numbers that a user must enter to join a game.

**Main lobby**: A screen where a logged-in user can start or join a game.


## Overview, scenarios and use cases
1. Overview
   * The application is a user-end multiplayer browser-based game written primarily in C#, using the Unity Game Development engine.
3. Accessibility
   * The application should be accessible by any user, administrative or not, through any web browser using standard Hypertext Transfer protocol. The application should function as an excecutable on any system capable of running Windows 10, provided said system operates with a minimum of 8 gigabytes of DDR4 RAM and a dual-core Intel Core-i3 processor (or equivalent).
4. Scenarios
   * The application should be accessed via Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox and each instance of it should be terminable from either browser, respectively. Any given instance of use of said application should be terminable upon no more than half an hour of execution, and each instance should occupy no more than approximately 3 MB of the system's L1 cache. 
5. Use Cases
   * A given instance of the application's use should be as follows:
   * The user logs in via standard hypertext transfer protocol.
   * The server should respond accordingly, and with ideal performance, the server should operate with a ping of approximately 100 ms or less.
   * The server will accommodate up to four users in any given instance of the application.
   * An instance of the game will terminate when all users log out of the application and the connection to the server is terminated.

## High-Level System Architecture

### Database

Use MySQL database service on the Lamp server. The database will store the playersâ€™ login information (unique username and hashed password), game data, and their highest score.

### Server
Use our groupâ€™s LAMP server provided by the university.

### Client-Server Relationship

* Client-side: JavaScript
* Server-side: PHP

### APIâ€™s

* Last.fm API: Allows the exploring of the entire collection of the websiteâ€™s music data resources, such as artists and playlists.
https://english.api.rakuten.net/dimashirokov/api/LastFm

### Supported Browsers
* Google Chrome
* Firefox

### GUI
